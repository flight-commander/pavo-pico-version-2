Make sure your goggles are bound to the DJI O3 air unit and the DJI controller too.

Even though the drone doesn’t flip when you press the AUX 4 button, it actually works as a back/reset button. When the drone crashes or lands; AUX 4 reset it so you can ARM the drone again without needing to take the battery out to do a hard reset.

_________________________

You can remove AUX 4 but drone seems to have trouble arming again if you don’t have the AUX 4 button.
